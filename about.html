            <h1>About CRISPO</h1>
            <p>Chri-Spo-Fest: In 1994, on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the founding of the University as Christ College in 1969, the Department of Physical Education commemorated this milestone by introducing Christ College Sports Festival (CHRI-SPO-FEST). It is an open invitational inter-university and inter-collegiate tournament in which University and college teams from even other states participate. The campus comes alive during the festival that lasts for 8-10 days.  Participated by 55-60 reputed institutions, CHRISPO has earned respect and recognition, and it has become one of the most awaited extracurricular fests in Karnataka. CRISPO is Christ University's premier annual sports event where various universities participate in exciting competitions across multiple sports. It is designed to promote sportsmanship, teamwork, and healthy competition among students.</p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To create a platform that fosters athletic excellence, nurtures talent, and promotes inter-university collaboration.</p>
